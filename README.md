Mini games.

As part of a personal project I'll be creating and adding small games to this repo.
As my skills develop I plan to further develop each game and pursue more challenging ideas
These games are avenues to explore different ideas and work on the process of creating and developing ideas.

The games are written in Javascript and can be played in the command line with node.
As I develop them further, browser compatability and simple graphics will be added too.

#Current games

Pick your path - The game has 3 modes of difficulty and in each mode you have to type in an option from 1-6 to try and avoid the traps. It logs how many times you pick the right path and ends if you fail.
The gamesize and difficulty percentages can easily be changed for further building. 

Gamba - The game works like a slot machine. You have a staring balance of 300 and are prompted what to wager. Your new balance is returned and you are given the option to wager again. If your balance goes to 0 you can't play anymore.
